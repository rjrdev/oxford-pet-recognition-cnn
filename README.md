# Oxford IIIT Pet Recognition CNN

## Overview
This repo contains an interactive Python Notebook containing a customized FasterRCNN model built using PyTorch. The goal of the object recognition model is to accurately detect and classify pets within the Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset. The output of the model will be:
This repo contains an interactive Python Notebook containing a multi-layer neural network built using Keras + Tensorflow. The goal of this classifier is to predict whether health records have an increased change of heart attack or not.
